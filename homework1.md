Homework 1

what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be
like, if there was no software on a central server:

1. Cheating
 The consensus algorythm would not allow the cheating on payments, moving their figures and buying properties, since it solves the Byzantine problem.
2. Ensuring agreement about the state of the system
 The beauty of blockchain lies in the fact that it provides us with a virtual machine, such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that offers a range of tools to ensure that the system remains in the correct state.
3. Communication problems (timeouts)
 There would be a limited time given to a players, when they could communicate. It would be not more than 1:30 minutes, since it is enough to make a decision for a next move.
4. How to decide who should take the next turn
 The randomizer could solve the problem, giving to a players their turn.
5. How to allow the correct people to join the game
 The enetring to the game could cost a certain amount of money to the creator of the game, and giving an online reciept to the creator would confirm that cpecific person is the correct player.
